# Exam-Seating-System
A Java-based console application that helps organize and assign students to exam rooms based on their roll numbers and subjects, ensuring students from the same subject are not seated consecutively. The system also respects a user-defined room capacity.

🛠️ Features
🧑‍🎓 Add student details (Name, Roll Number, Subject)

🔢 Sort students based on roll number

🔄 Arrange students to avoid consecutive seating of same-subject students

🏫 Divide students into rooms based on a maximum capacity

📋 Print structured room-wise seating arrangement💻 

How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter:

Maximum number of students allowed per room

Number of students

Each student's name, roll number, and subject

2. The system:

Sorts students by roll number

Ensures consecutive students have different subjects

Groups students into rooms as per the limit

Finally, a clean room-wise seating arrangement is printed.
